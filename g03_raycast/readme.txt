-- [. About .] --------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Ported from a demo I put together with Corona
- Originally written in Turbo Pascal around 1997
- The original engine (in Pascal) contained many more features that were cut for this demo
- Cut down feature list for this demo
- Depth shading on the walls
- Basic movement implemented
- Uses precalced math tables for some speed gain
- Easy to customise further and continue adding features
- Could do with optimising at some point
- Textures used in this demo were not created by me, but found freely available on the net


-- [. Future Plans .] -------------------------------------------------------------------

Although this was only created as a demo of sorts, I wouldn't mind adding some more features.
This will depend on time, as I don't plan to use this engine for anything at present.
- Transparent walls
- Better movement and player clipping
- Doors
