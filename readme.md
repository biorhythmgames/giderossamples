Gideros samples are a range of small demo projects using the Gideros SDK. In most cases, they are a direct port from one we made with the Corona SDK. Each sample is free to download and use.

Each project is assigned an id (e.g G01) which represents the order each sample was started in. Not all Corona samples have been ported and their project numbers will not match up.
